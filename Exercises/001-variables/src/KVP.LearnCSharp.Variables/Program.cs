// Exercise C: Make sum = 18 by changing y.

// Exercise D: set a breakpoint at line 13, where x is declared
// and initialized. Use the "step" feature to see how y and sum is
// assigned.

// Exercise E: in the two lines preceding this, we are reassigning x. However, we

// reassign it to a different value? Does it affect 'sum'? Why / why not?
